    <hr>
    <p>When visiting the Big Apple, there are a few main attractions that you won’t want to miss out on, such as Central Park, Coney Island, and the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. Car rentals in New York are a great way to quickly and easily travel to these sights. Keep your eyes open for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, a major road that connects several boroughs in the city. It’s also important to note that many roads feeding into the city require drivers to pay tolls, including the George Washington Bridge and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial Bridge. While parking on the street in New York is known for being difficult, there are many garages and metered spaces for you to choose from. There are upwards of 150 car rental locations in New York.</p>

    <p class="qa-title">Is it worthwhile renting a car while visiting New York City?</p>
    <p>While parking in the city can seem like a daunting task due to how busy it is, there are plenty of parking garages and metered spaces for you to choose from when looking for parking for car rentals in New York. New York is a vibrant city that is known for having quite a few traffic hot spots on its main roads, like the Whitestone Expressway and the Hutchinson Parkway. Traffic tends to be heaviest in the early mornings and evenings, so try to avoid driving New York car rentals during these times. Car rentals in New York make it easy to explore some of the popular attractions in the surrounding region, like Cold Spring and Washington, D.C, which can be reached in just a few hours. While parts of the city are quite walkable or connected by public transport, a cheap car rental in New York can still be an easy and affordable way to travel between neighborhoods. It’s also particularly convenient during the winter months, as New York is known for having quite a lot of snow, which is not ideal for walking.</p>

    <p class="qa-title">What different driving laws should I keep in mind while driving in New York City?</p>
    <p>To be as safe as possible when driving a rented car in NYC, there are a few traffic regulations that you should keep in mind. For example, drivers are not allowed to stop in intersections when they cannot clear the intersection due to traffic. Children under the age of six are also required to either be in a child’s seat or booster seat, which you can add to your car rental. You must always stay a distance that is equivalent to two seconds from the car that is in front of you, and this distance needs to be increased during adverse weather conditions. You must always yield to pedestrians, even if they are crossing in an unmarked zone. Left-hand lanes are typically for those that are passing other vehicles, so try to stay in the right-hand lane when you are not doing this. If you have any doubts, check with New York’s department of motor vehicles to receive information on any traffic laws that may have changed.

    <p class="qa-title">Can I drive to Canada or Mexico with a rental car from New York?</p>
    <p>When you book car rentals in New York, you are usually allowed to cross the border with your vehicle, whether it be to go to Canada or Mexico. If you travel to one of these countries with a New York car rental, keep in mind that you will need to have a few documents, such as a valid driver’s license and your passport. Those that will be driving to Canada will need to have a non-resident insurance card, while those going to Mexico will need to have Mexican Automobile Liability Insurance, both of which can be acquired through your chosen car rental company. Make sure to notify your car rental company in advance if you plan on crossing the border with your vehicle.

    <p class="qa-title">Can you rent a rental car in New York without a credit card?</p>
    <p>To reserve car rentals in New York, whether it be an economy car rental or a passenger van rental, most companies typically prefer that you pay with a major credit card, rather than alternative methods, such as cash, check, and debit cards. However, it’s important to note that in the state of New York, it is illegal to refuse to rent a car to a customer just because they do not have a credit card. If you do not have a credit card, a rental company may require you to go through an additional screening process prior to picking up your vehicle, even for cheap car rentals in New York. Those that plan on paying with an alternative method should always check with their chosen rental company a few days before their reservation begins in order to verify what the exact procedure will be. Keep in mind that the credit card, debit card, or check that is used for the booking will normally need to be in the name of one of the individuals that will be operating the vehicle. If you do not pay with a credit card, you may be asked to make a cash deposit.</p>

    <p class="qa-title">What documents does an international traveler need to rent a car in New York?</p>
    <p>If you are an international traveler and would like to rent a car in New York, there are a few different documents that you will be required to provide. All drivers must be able to show a valid driver’s license, and this license cannot expire during your rental period. If you do not have a license from the United States, you can either use an international driver’s license, or a driver’s license from your home country. If your foreign driver’s license is not in a Latin-based alphabet, you may be asked to provide an official translation. Whether you use an international license or a foreign license, you will also need to present a copy of your passport for your chosen rental company to keep with your file. Keep in mind that to rent a car in New York, most companies will require you to be at least 18 years old.
